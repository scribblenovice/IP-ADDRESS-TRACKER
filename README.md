# IP-ADDRESS-TRACKER
This is an ip address tracker web app that can track the location of an ip address provided by an ISP
Built using vanilla javascript, IPgeolocation API, Leaflet.js and openstreet map
ISPs make use of automatic DHCP to assign ip addresses. So the ip adress on your device (private) would be different from the one assigned by your isp(public). Check online to know your public IP address
Also, the accuracy for it to pinpoint your location varies depending on your country. For, Nigeria, the accuracy is around 75% for a 50 mile radius.
Also, the location displayed on open street map isnt your actual location but that of the ISP access point servicing your device
